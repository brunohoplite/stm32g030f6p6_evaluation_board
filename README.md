# STM32G030F6P6 Evaluation board

This project's objective is to allow the evalution of the STM32G030F6 MCU based on a powerful Cortex-M0+ that can run at 64Mhz.
It has 32KB of Flash and 8KB of RAM and a very low price point.

The motivation behind this project are:
- Given the chip shortage, less powerful (but fully capable!) MCU like this one are still more available than others
- There are no development or evaluation boards for this specific MCU

The FW is developped and compiled in STM32CubeIDE v1.6.1. For debugging you'll need an ST-LINK/V2 which can also be used to download the program. It is also possible to download it via USB.
